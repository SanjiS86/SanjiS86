In September 2021 I learned Swift and in December 2021 I made an iOS app for stock investors called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stock-target-price/id1589969451">Stock Target Price</a>. This is a stock target price calculator, investment ideas geenrator and buy signal. It is very difficult to calculate a stock fair value because all the models require analysts assymptions and long 10 year forecasts of a company's financial statements. This is very time consuming process and it is difficult even for experienced financial analysts. Not all retail traders/investors can do it. I decided to help retail investors and build an app that calculates stock target price in seconds and provides great investment ideas. Now investors can know what is their selected stock growth potential and buy amazing stocks. In August 2022 I completely finished the project. Stock Target Price v1.11 

This app does the following:

1. Calculates selected stock target price (fair value) and growth potential.
2. Defines great time to trade stocks for the short term.
3. Provides trade ideas with fundamental reasoning.

In February 2022 I started learning web development, and in April 2022 I developed <a href="https://diversset.com/">Diversset</a>. Stock and ETF search tool. Efficient investment portfolio builder. Through my professional trader and lecturer career, I met a lot of people who struggled to find great stocks and manage portfolio risk. Because not all of them had needed time or knowledge to manage their portfolios and search for ideal stocks that will best fit their strategies. Thats why I decided to build a Diversset that searches stocks and ETFs based on client's risk appetite and builds an efficient investment portfolio, allocating asset weights in such a way as to minimize the portfolio expected loss and maximize the return. I made a lot of great updates since April and completely finished it only on 2 september 2023. Diversset v 1.12. Still need to make more great updates but the main core of the project is finished. 

Diversset does the following:

1. Finds stocks and ETFS tailored to user's risk appetite.
2. Builds an efficient investment portfolio.
   Or
3. Maximizes return and minimizes the expected loss.

In December 2022 I made another iOS app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stocks-2-buy/id6444135874">Stocks 2 buy</a>. The problem with equity analysis is that the valuation and analysis process is very confusing for beginner investors, due to many assumptions, models and financial ratios that you have to take into consideration.  I decided to make an easy way for investors to choose stocks and made an app that provides stock trade recommendations (buy, sell, neutral) based on three very important indicators. I released the basic version of the app but it is still under development. Still need to improve the design and the recommendation assigning algorythm. 

Stocks 2 buy does the following: 

1. Provides stock trade recommendations.
2. Provides investors with market analytics and forecast.

Recently I made two great updates on Diversset webpage:
1) I made a <a href="https://diversset.com/stockMarketBlog">Stock Market Blog</a> where I share educational articles on stock selection, equity valuation, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, portfolio management and risk management.
2) I created <a href="https://diversset.com/ideas">Stock Market Forecast</a> and Analytics section where investors can read monthly analytics and forecasts for the US stock market and understand what events were driving the market in the past month and what to expect in coming month.
